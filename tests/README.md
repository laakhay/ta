# Root Test Scaffolding

This root `tests/` directory is reserved for cross-runtime validation suites:
- Rust vs Python parity
- Rust vs Node parity (future)
- Interop and contract conformance fixtures
- Repository-level performance baselines

Language-specific Python tests live under `python/tests/`.
Rust crate tests live under `crates/*/tests/`.
