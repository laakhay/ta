# Core Concepts

The TA package is built around a few strict principles from `README.md` and `VISION.md`.

## Stateless and Immutable

- Series and bars are immutable inputs
- Runtime evaluation does not keep hidden mutable global state
- Precision and timestamps are explicit

## Registry Driven Indicators

Indicators are described with metadata and schemas:

- parameter definitions
- aliases
- lookback requirements
- expected input semantics

This makes the same indicator definitions usable for runtime execution, expression parsing, and UI/tooling introspection.

## Algebraic Composition

Indicator handles and literals compose into expression graphs:

- arithmetic and boolean operators
- nested indicator expressions
- inspectable dependency structure

This is foundational for strategy building, requirement planning, and runtime explainability.

## Multi-Source by Design

Beyond OHLCV, the model supports derived sources from trades/orderbook/liquidations so users can write richer conditions without forking execution logic.
