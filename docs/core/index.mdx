# Core Data Model

`laakhay-ta` works on immutable typed structures. Understanding these is key to writing reliable indicators and expressions.

## Main Types

- `Bar`: one OHLCV candle.
- `OHLCV`: columnar immutable candle container.
- `Series[T]`: generic timestamp-aligned immutable vector.
- `Dataset`: multi-symbol, multi-timeframe, multi-source store.
- `SeriesContext`: dynamic named series container used by indicators.

## Design Principles

- Immutability for deterministic evaluation.
- Explicit timestamp alignment.
- Data-source neutrality (`ohlcv`, `trades`, `orderbook`, `liquidation`).
- Strong separation between data representation and expression runtime.

## Why This Matters

Most errors in strategy systems come from hidden alignment or missing-field assumptions. The core model makes those assumptions explicit and testable.
