# Core Data Model

Core types are immutable and timestamp-ordered. This makes expression evaluation deterministic and safer to reason about in concurrent systems.

## Main Types

- `Bar`: single OHLCV bar with validation and derived price helpers.
- `OHLCV`: columnar immutable container of bars.
- `Series[T]`: generic immutable time series with arithmetic and transformations.
- `Dataset`: multi-symbol, multi-timeframe, multi-source container.
- Source contexts: `OHLCVContext`, `TradeContext`, `OrderBookContext`, `LiquidationContext`.
