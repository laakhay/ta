# Runtime Guardrails

Use runtime helpers before promoting expressions:

- `validate(...)`: syntax/schema/capability checks
- `analyze(...)`: sources/timeframes/lookback requirements
- `preview(...)`: output + trigger sanity checks

This is the fastest way to catch invalid/expensive expressions before runtime deployment.
