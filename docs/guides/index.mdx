# Guides

These guides focus on practical execution patterns beyond API reference docs.

## Guide Set

- `signal-workflow`: end-to-end authoring to execution flow.
- `multisource-patterns`: combining OHLCV/trades/orderbook/liquidation.
- `runtime-guardrails`: production safety and failure-mode handling.

Read these after you complete `getting-started` and `expression-language` sections.
