# Performance

Benchmarks live under `tests/performance` and target expression compilation/evaluation paths.

## Practical Guidance

- Reuse compiled expressions in hot paths.
- Use planner requirements to fetch only required fields/sources.
- Keep dataset source keys normalized for fast resolution.
- Avoid unnecessary conversions between raw payloads and core structures.

## Benchmark Entry Points

- `tests/performance/test_evaluation_benchmarks.py`
