# Testing & Performance

A good TA expression stack is only useful if outputs are reproducible and explainable.

## Test Layers

- unit tests for indicator math and edge cases,
- parser/compiler tests for syntax and node conversion,
- runtime tests for evaluate/preview/validate behavior,
- integration tests with multisource datasets.

## Performance Focus

- reuse compiled expressions,
- use planner/evaluator cache-aware paths,
- limit unnecessary dataset fan-out when evaluating single symbols.

See `test-matrix` and `performance` for details.
