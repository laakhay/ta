# Integration Notes

This page summarizes practical integration points when using `laakhay-ta` from services like Kendra.

## Input Expectations

- normalized symbols/timeframes
- consistent source naming
- aligned timestamps where strategy logic requires pairwise operations

## Planner Output Usage

Use expression planning output to drive data subscriptions and prefetch requirements before evaluation.

## Recommended Backend Pattern

1. compile expression once
2. derive required sources/lookbacks
3. feed normalized datasets to runtime
4. evaluate and emit typed results
5. log/trace requirement and evaluation metadata for debugging

## Current Documentation Scope

This docs-site covers principles and usage patterns.
Detailed API pages and exhaustive examples are planned next.
