# Indicators

`laakhay-ta` currently registers trend, momentum, volatility, volume, pattern, event, and primitive indicators.

This section contains:

- complete current inventory (generated from the live registry)
- alias map
- extension pattern for custom indicators

Indicator registration is schema-driven and thread-safe via registry locks.
