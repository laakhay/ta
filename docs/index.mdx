# Introduction

`laakhay-ta` is a stateless technical analysis library focused on composability, explicit metadata, and multi-source strategy expression.

It is designed as the TA engine used by Laakhay systems, but shaped as a standalone library with clear contracts for backend integration.

## What This Library Is For

- Indicator execution over immutable series
- Algebraic expression composition for signals
- Multi-source data access (OHLCV, trades, orderbook, liquidations)
- Streaming-compatible evaluation with deterministic behavior
