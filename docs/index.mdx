`laakhay-ta` is a stateless technical analysis engine for indicator computation, expression evaluation, and multi-source signal logic.

## Recommended Reading Order

1. `getting-started/*`
2. `guides/*`
3. `expression-language/*`
4. `runtime/*`
5. `api/*` and `indicators/*` as reference

## What You Can Build Quickly

- single and multi-indicator signals
- multi-source expressions (`ohlcv`, `trades`, `orderbook`, `liquidation`)
- validation/analysis gates before deployment
- requirement-aware execution plans

## Ecosystem Fit

- `laakhay-data` for ingestion/normalization
- `laakhay-ta` for indicator + signal logic
- `laakhay-quantlab` for simulation and stochastic analysis
