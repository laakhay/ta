# Planning & Requirements

Planner components convert expression graphs into execution plans and data requirements.

## Why Planning Exists

A strategy expression is not only math. It also implies:

- required data sources and fields,
- lookback windows,
- alignment policy,
- execution order.

Planner output makes these explicit before runtime.

## Main Objects

- `Graph` / `GraphNode`
- `PlanResult`
- `SignalRequirements`
- `DataRequirement`
- `AlignmentPolicy`

See `requirements` and `capability-manifest` for details.
