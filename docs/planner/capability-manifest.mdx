# Capability Manifest

Capability manifest describes what your system can parse and execute:

- available sources and fields,
- indicator catalog and aliases,
- operator support,
- source support by exchange,
- syntax examples.

Generated via planner runtime utilities.

## Why It Matters

- drive UI builders (dropdowns, autocomplete),
- preflight unsupported source/exchange combinations,
- keep frontend/backend strategy semantics synchronized.

## Typical Output Shape

```json
{
  "sources": {
    "ohlcv": {"fields": ["close", "high", "hlc3"]},
    "trades": {"fields": ["volume", "count"]}
  },
  "exchange_source_support": {
    "binance": {"ohlcv": {"rest": true, "ws": true}}
  },
  "indicators": [...],
  "operators": {...}
}
```
