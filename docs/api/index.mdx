# API Reference

The API is intentionally layered:

1. high-level `laakhay.ta` convenience functions,
2. namespace/handle APIs for composability,
3. registry/catalog APIs for metadata-driven systems.

## Which API Should You Use?

- Strategy authoring and research scripts: top-level API + DSL.
- Platform/service code: namespace + handles + runtime validate/analyze.
- UI/schema generation: registry + catalog + capability manifest.

See subpages for each layer.
