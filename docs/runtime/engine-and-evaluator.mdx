# Engine & Evaluator

This page is optional for most users.

For day-to-day strategy work, prefer:

- `compile_expression(...).run(dataset)`
- `preview(...)`
- `validate(...)`
- `analyze(...)`

`Engine` and `RuntimeEvaluator` are useful when you need explicit execution orchestration or are integrating TA evaluation into a custom service runtime.
